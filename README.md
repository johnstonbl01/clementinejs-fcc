## Overview

Clementine.js is a lightweight boilerplate for fullstack JavaScript development which utilizes MongoDB, Express and Node.js. The boilerplate errs on the side of transparency and simplicity, making it an ideal starting point for beginner and seasoned developers alike. 

The [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com) version of Clementine.js is meant for use when completing projects as part of the FCC curriculum. This version includes GitHub authentication using [Passport](http://passportjs.org/).

## Versions

There are 3 versions of Clementine.js:

- [**Standard**](https://github.com/johnstonbl01/clementinejs): the simplest version of Clementine.js. Intended for those who wish for the smallest and least intrusive footprint OR to implement features on their own.
- [**Angular**](https://github.com/johnstonbl01/clementinejs-angular): a slightly more complex version of the same application. This version employs the use of AngularJS as the front-end framework.
- **Free Code Camp (FCC)** (this version): A modified version of the standard boilerplate that is intended for use with the [Free Code Camp](http://freecodecamp.com/) curriculum.

# Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

In order to use Clementine.js, you must have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [NPM](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation & Startup

To install Clementine.js, simply enter the below in the terminal window:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/johnstonbl01/clementinejs-fcc.git your-project
```

This will install the Clementine.js components into the `your-project` directory.

### Setup GitHub Authentication

Please follow [this guide](http://www.clementinejs.com/tutorials/tutorial-passport.html#GitHubAppSetup) to register the application with GitHub and get API keys / secrets.

### Local Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env` in the root directory. This file should contain:

```
GITHUB_KEY=your-client-id-here
GITHUB_SECRET=your-client-secret-here
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/clementinejs
PORT=8080
APP_URL=http://localhost:8080/
```

### Starting the App

To start the app, make sure you're in the project directory and type `node server.js` into the terminal. This will start the Node server and connect to MongoDB.

You should the following messages within the terminal window:

```
Node.js listening on port 8080...
```

Next, open your browser and enter `http://localhost:8080/`. Congrats, you're up and running!

#### MongoDB Server
Note that the application will expect a mongodb server to be available. As
specified in your `.env` file's `MONGO_URI` key. If you do not have a server
running, you can start one by running the command: `mongod --port 27017`. Please
modify the actual port specified to match your `.env` file.
